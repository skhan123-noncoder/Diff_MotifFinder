# Diff_MotifFinder
Highlighting Differences in TF motif occupancy in very similar DNA sequences 

#Introduction
A common observation in high-throughput sequencing data, particularly in developmental and disease context, is the subtle yet important variation in near identical enhancer sequences. Such variations, and the Transcription factor binding differences brought on by such minute differences, can provide critical insights into the regulatory processes involved in disease conditions. We incorporated the MAST function from MEME suite to provide users with a platform to quickly identify the nature and location of such changes.
